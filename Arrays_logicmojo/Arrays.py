"""
Time Complexity - Amount of time taken by the program to run
Space complexity - Amount of space taken by the program
Big O notation allows us to know how long and how much space a program takes to run
O(1) -> Constant time and constant space
O(N) -> Linear time to complete
For any expression, always consider largest degree eg: 2x^2+3x+3 -> O(x^2)
